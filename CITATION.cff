abstract: The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) is an open-source modelling framework for
  ice sheets and glaciers. Its features include a hierarchy of available stress balances,
  marine ice sheet physics with dynamic calving fronts, an enthalpy-based conservation of
  energy scheme, bed deformation and subglacial hydrology components, extensible coupling
  to atmospheric and ocean models, and comprehensive user documentation. PISM uses
  distributed-memory (PETSc- and MPI-based) parallelism for high-resolution simulations.

  PISM is jointly developed at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) and the Potsdam
  Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
